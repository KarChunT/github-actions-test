# Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns
- Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
- Explicit (Constructor) bs implicit (DI, Reflection)
- Wholesale (single statement) vs piecewise (step-by-step)

## Structural Patterns
- Concerned with the structure (eg: class members)
- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface
- Stress the importance of good API design

## Behavioral Patterns
- They are all different; no central theme
